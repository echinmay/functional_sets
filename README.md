Coursera had conducted a functional programming course in scala. As part of that course there was an assignment to implement a functional set. See https://class.coursera.org/progfun-005/assignment/view?assignment_id=3. This is a go implementation of the same. If this is in violation of the honor code let me know and I will pull it down. The assignment asked to implement this in scala. This is in go. Hence I am sure it does not violate the honor code directly. 

If you can convince me that this is a violation of the honor code I will pull it down immediately.
